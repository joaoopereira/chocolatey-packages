[QLC+](https://www.qlcplus.org/) is a free and cross-platform software to control DMX or analog lighting systems like moving heads, dimmers, scanners etc.\
This project is a fork of the great QLC project written by Heikki Junnila that aims to continue the QLC development and to introduce new features.\
The primary goal is to bring QLC+ at the level of other lighting control commercial softwares.\
QLC+ runs on Linux, Windows (7+), macOS (10.7+) and the Raspberry Pi.
